# RT Raleway

RT Raleway is an alternate version of [Raleway](https://github.com/impallari/Raleway/ "Raleway Typeface") that utilizes the stylistic alternates of the "A" and "W" as default glyphs. Additionally, oldstyle or lowercase numerals are replaced with lining numerals as the default figure style.
